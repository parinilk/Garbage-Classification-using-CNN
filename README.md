🚮 Garbage Classification using CNN with AI-Generated Image Prediction 🔮

Introduction,

This project aims to develop a computer vision system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify different types of garbage or waste materials. 🗑️ Additionally, it showcases the garbage classification model through a user-friendly web interface built with HTML and CSS. 🌐 One unique feature of this project is the integration of an AI-generated image functionality, where users can generate synthetic images of garbage items, and the trained CNN model will predict the class of the generated image. 🤖
Problem Statements
Proper waste sorting and classification are essential for effective recycling and waste management processes. However, manually sorting and categorizing waste can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. 😩 This project leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision to automate the process of garbage classification, improving efficiency and accuracy. 🚀 Furthermore, the web interface and AI-generated image prediction provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for exploring the capabilities of the model. 🤩

Methodology,

The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks. CNNs are capable of automatically learning and extracting relevant features from images, enabling accurate classification of garbage types. 🧠
The main steps involved in this project include:

Data Collection: Gathering a diverse dataset of labeled images representing different types of garbage or waste materials. 🖼️

Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the image data to enhance the model's performance and generalization. 🔄

Model Architecture: Designing and implementing an appropriate CNN architecture suitable for the garbage classification task. 🏗️

Model Training: Training the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset, with techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning to improve accuracy. 💪

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance on a separate test dataset and analyzing relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 📊

Web Interface Development: Building a user-friendly web interface using HTML and CSS to showcase the garbage classification model. 🌐

AI-Generated Image Integration: Implementing an AI-based image generation functionality that allows users to create synthetic images of garbage items, which the trained CNN model can then classify. 🤖🎨

Deployment: Deploying the web application with the trained model and AI-generated image functionality for real-world garbage classification scenarios. 🚀
